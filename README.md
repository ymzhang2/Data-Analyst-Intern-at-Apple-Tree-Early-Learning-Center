**My responsibility**
*Wrote complicated SQL queries to manipulate data for further analysis 
*Created dashboard reports to assist curriculum designers in learning the effect of curriculum on student performance using Tableau and R
*Applied regression analysis, data mining and statistical descriptive using R to help statistician refine curriculum
*Cleaned data collected by over 60 teachers using advanced Excel spreadsheet formulas and uploaded the cleaned data into MySQL database
*Collobrated with database developer to maintain database
*Presented my finding to stakeholders and communicated effectively with end users
*Worked closely with internal department to drive project success

## Introduction for Attached Samples
**FSG Report**
SQL query for manipulating data to design a report for lead principal teacher to learn student perfromance 
**FSG Research Project**
a spreadsheet created by two statisticians, a database developer and I to refine curriculum

my responsibility for this project is to perform quantitative research analysis on each quesiton and present the findings to stakeholder

The research questions are listed below ordering by their priporities. For each questions, I listed how I manipulate data using SQL and analyzed data using R in a spreadsheet

*How many times does an exit have to be given? When in a plan are exits given?
*What is the average exit time for each plan (T1-T3)?
*Compare exits to PM.
*4. Which plans are most/least used at each quarter/between PM windows, by age?
*5. What plans are used between each PM window?
*6. How many times is a lesson repeated? Which plans have the greatest "rate" of reteaching overall?
*7. Look at all daily's for a plan together - validity.
*8. Compare daily's to exits.
*9. Compare (set of) daily to weekly.
*10. Compare weekly assessment to exits.
*11. Rate of change from group to group?
*12. Does the rate of changing plans have any relationship with student scores on the PM?
